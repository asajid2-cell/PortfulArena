title: "Kinetic Ops Dashboard"
summary: "Real-time monitoring suite for an industrial robotics team with inertial navigation between bays."
problem: "Operators struggled to triage incidents quickly because the legacy UI was static and slow to surface context."
insight: "By mapping gestures to velocity and aligning visuals with the physical system, we could reduce cognitive load for technicians."
approach: "Astro for content, Next.js embedded for authenticated views, and a shared Tailwind token set so product and marketing shipped the same design language."
outcome: "Incident acknowledgment time dropped by 28%, and operators requested that we roll the new system out across three additional plants."

## Systems thinking

The team manages dozens of tops (robots) across multiple bays. We aligned the UX with the mental model by making each bay a card with real-time telemetry, spin-down states, and escalation shortcuts.

## Contributions

- Architected the telemetry pipeline with WebSockets and graceful degradation to SSE
- Co-designed the interaction model so velocity-based gestures felt intuitive with gloves on
- Created MDX powered runbooks so ops could document clashes and resolutions inline

## Result

Deployment shipped with zero downtime, and the same codebase now powers digital signage and the executive overview mode.
