title: "Nebula Arena"
summary: "Immersive launch experience for a physics puzzle game, blending R3F motion with responsive storytelling."
problem: "The studio needed a performant teaser site that matched the kinetic feel of their gameplay without relying on heavy video files."
insight: "We could simulate the clash of spinning tops with lightweight procedural shaders and spring-based motion, keeping the bundle lean."
approach: "Astro for static output, React islands for the arena canvas, and a Tailwind-powered design system that mirrored the in-game arena surfaces."
outcome: "Bounce rate dropped by 34%, and the launch waitlist filled in 72 hours thanks to the interactive walkthrough."

## Overview

Players land in a launch bay where the arena comes alive: orbits trace neon rings, tops clash with subtle sparks, and the story unfolds as you scroll or flick through bays.

## What I delivered

- Built a physics-inspired hero experience with R3F and custom shader materials
- Authored modular MDX content for the campaign timeline
- Tuned performance to keep the initial payload under 140 KB gzipped

## Behind the scenes

I prototyped the arena interactions with Framer Motion velocity tracking, then ported the math into React Three Fiber for a consistent motion language between DOM and WebGL layers.
